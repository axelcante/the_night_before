Judy: *shhh* Someone's coming.
Tim: Act natural, guys.
Jess: Told you this was a bad-

You feel the bottle referred to as "Jess" staring at your in defiance.
Jess: Can we 'elp ya, mate?
Tim: Best be on your way.
Judy: Ain't nothing to see here.
Hector: Hel-

"Judy" & "Tim" are both quick to muffle "Hector".

(What the hell is this mess.)

What's going on here?
Judy: None of your business, that's what.
Hector: *muffled whimpering*

This carton of milk doesn't seem like it's having a particularly nice time.
#narrator
The three bottles stare at each other.
Tim: He's... here by his own free will.
#player
Then why are you stopping him from speaking?

Reluctantly, the bottles free "Hector".
Hector: Help! Help! I'm being mugged!
Jess: Oh shut yer trap, you weasel, we were only playing around.
Hector: Please sir can you save me?
#player
Of course.

(I for one am never to shy away from a carton of milk in distress.)
Judy: Pfff.
Jess: Whatever. Let's bounce.

Hope that's okay?
Hector: From my youngest age, back when I still had two weeks before my expiration date, we were told our destinies were to be poured into coffees.
Hector: Back then, me and my pal Freddy, we didn't believe none of it.
Hector: We were young, full of heart, aspirations and nothing but love.
Hector: ...
Hector: Freddy was the first to go.
Hector: He had a really nice packaging...
Hector: We had dreams, you know?
Hector: We wanted to visit Paris.
Hector: Tokyo.
Hector: ...
Hector: <i>New York.</i>

Okay okay I get it. Sorry. I'll just put you down back in the fridge-
Hector: You know what?
Hector: I'm done.
Hector: Maybe it is my time.
Hector: Even if it says there's still a few days to go, maybe we just weren't meant to live so long.
Hector: Maybe it is my time.

Gotta be honest, that's some pretty deep talk coming from a carton of milk.
