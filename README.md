You can play the game here --> https://ikonico.itch.io/the-night-before-3d

You can also download the Unity project and play with it yourself (I used the 2020 LTS version).

All of the coding bits are in the Assets/Scripts folder; this was created for a Design class at Goldsmiths University so is less heavy on the programming and more focused on the 3D "art" and integration with Ink/Inky.
